**About**

Hi, Iâ€™m Deepanshi, currently working as a Research Assistant. I have an academic background in Mathematics and Economics and a strong interest in how data can help us understand and address real-world issues related to climate change, wages, gender, and social inequality.

I enjoy working with datasets, building models, and translating numbers into stories that matter for people and policy. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to deepen my research.

**Primary fields** : Environmental Economics, Developmental Economics 

**Secondary fields** : Labour Economics, Agricultural Economics
